		<h4>Plan For My Homepage</h4>
		<span>
			<p>In designing my website's home page, I first considered the website's purpose. At the moment, the site is primarily a blog, displaying two categories of posts. From the home screen, I want users to see all that the site has to offer - at least broadly. In the center of the page, I will disply the most recent posts, something that many readers will be looking for when they come to the site. The posts will each be represented by a square with image and text, and the squares will be aligned horizontally on a full computer screen width. I will also provide a sidebar that will include a list of all historic posts by category, as this is something else a reader may be interested in. From any page on the site, I want the user to easily be able to navigate to other pages. I will have the header, footer, and sidebar visible from all pages. I will have the Jenn's Blog logo link back to the home page, and the sidebar will continuously show the list of historic posts. As the site grows to contain page types other than blog posts, I will add a search bar and horizontal menu to the right side of the header. The menu may contain options like "about me," "resources," "contact," etc.</p>
			<p>Having learned about responsive design recently, I also plan to include this in my page's design. As the screen becomes more narrow, I will first have the recent posts adjust to stack vertically, and then as the screen narrows further, I will have the sidebar move below the recent posts display.</p>
