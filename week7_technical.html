			<h3></h3>
			<p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language developed in the 1970s to manage data held in RDBMS (relational database management systems). SQL became the most popular database language and an industry standard. NoSQL (Not Only SQL) was developed in the 2000s to address changing needs in the industry.</p>

			<h3>Flexibility</h3>
			<p>SQL databases require an administrator to input data in a relatively inflexible format. Schemas must be created before any data is input. These schemas are difficult to modify in response to changing project needs. NoSQL on the other hand, allows much more flexible data input and modification. There are multiple types of NoSQL databases. Generally, though, the administrator can add data before knowing exactly what the schema will look like. He can also add data and change the schema easily. This is ideal for agile development.</p>

			<h3>Scaling and Concurrency</h3>
			<p>SQL datbases are meant to be scaled vertically. This means that a database's entirety is stored on one server. This is non-ideal for accomodating unpredictable growth and for maintaining uninterrupted service. NoSQL databases, on the other hand can be scaled horizontally. This means that it is easy to store a database on multiple servers, and to add or remove servers without disrupting service. Processing responsibility is also dividided over these multiple servers to run multiple sections of code concurrently, reducing processing time.</p>

			<h3>Processing Time</h3>
			<p>One criticism of SQL is its lack of speed. However, this is not a problem in many cases. Computer processing speeds and RDBMS's are faster today than ever, satisfying the speed requirements for many applications. Caching is also used to increase speed.</p>

			<h3>Application</h3>
			<p>Ultimately, the choice of SQL versus NoSQL should be made based on the application. SQL should be used in applications that lend themselves well to a relational database model. However, when working with data that does not fit well into this structure, NoSQL may be useful alternative.</p>
