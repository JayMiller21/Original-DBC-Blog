			<p>When I think of the times in my life when I've been the happiest, proudest, or the most satisfied, the following values come to mind: Community, Connection, Influence, Accomplishment, Growth, Exploration, Discovery, Learning, Self-knowledge, Self-awareness, Presence, Groundedness, Nature</p>
			<p>Many of these overlap and inter-relate. One of the most central of these values is growth. I spent much of my life with a black and white impression of the world. This mindset included an assumption that when working toward a goal, I would (at some undetermined point in the future) reach perfection. I've since figured out that no one ever gets anything "perfect," and this is not a metric I should measure myself with. Rather, I've come to pay attention to my progress toward making my self and my actions meet my intentions. As long as I am growing, I am proud of myself.</p>
			<p>Below, I rank the degree to which I try to live up to the values I list above. The scale is 1 though 5, with 5 representing the greatest amount I integrate the value into my life.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Community: 3</li>
				<li>Connection: 5</li>
				<li>Influence: 4</li>
				<li>Accomplishment: 5</li>
				<li>Growth: 5</li>
				<li>Exploration: 5</li>
				<li>Discovery: 5</li>
				<li>Learning: 5</li>
				<li>Self-knowledge: 5 </li>
				<li>Self-awareness: 4</li>
				<li>Presence: 4</li>
				<li>Groundedness: 5</li>
				<li>Nature: 3</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The last topic about which someone asked my advice was resolving a disagreement with his significant other. I was happy to be able to offer a perspective that my friend found useful.</p>
			<p>When I think about my values, I feel excited. I can still remember a time when I was younger, and feeling like I didn't have much of a personality. Now that I know so much more about what's important to me, I can better live my life accordingly.</p>
			<p>One of the values I listed is self-awareness. I think that this is an important value toward combating stereotype threat. When I am self-aware, I can catch self-defeating thoughts, including reactions to perceived stereotype threat. Being aware of these feelings is the first step toward disempowering them. In the best case scenario, I will be able to recognize that thoughts are just in my head and do not necessarily mean anything about reality; I will be able to thoughtfully respond to a situation, rather than instinctually react to it. This awareness will be my number 1 tool for dealing with negative feelings I may experience during DBC. I'm always working to improve my self-awareness, because again, there is no perfection!</p>
