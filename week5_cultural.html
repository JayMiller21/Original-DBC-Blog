			<p>Here at Dev Bootcamp, the curriculum places a significant focus on constructive teamwork and feedback. This involves regular pairing sessions between students. In these sessions, students work together to solve a challenge, and then provide feedback to one another about their respective teamwork and technical skills.</p>

			<p>Pairing with others to solve challenges is not something I would have chosen to do on my own. I generally find it helpful to consult others when I encounter a particular difficulty in solving a problem. And likewise, I'm happy to help others with specific questions or difficulties. However, I generally like to work through problems on my own up until I reach that point. This seems natural to me - why have a partner work with me on the parts I can accomplish on my own? Additionally, I observed during college that I thought more slowly than a lot of people I attemped to solve engineering problems with. This repeated experience made me insecure about how I think and learn. To this day, I feel noticably anxious at the thought of someone observing my problem solving process. I also worry about my ability to keep pace with another individual so that I can equally contribute in a partnership.</p>

			<p>All that being said, I have been pleasantly surprised by the value I have given and received in most of my pairing sessions so far. The main benefit of a partnership is that everyone thinks differently. Even given a challenge I am able to complete alone, my parner may express his understanding of a concept in a way that broadens or augments my own understanding. Then, when tougher material comes along, our varied perspectives give us more collective wisdom with which to understand and solve a problem. As an amateur programmer, I am familiar with the difficulty that "you don't know what you don't know" in reference to technical material. Sometimes, you only find out about a handy new technical tool when someone tells you about it. In the same vein, I have had peers inform me of text editor shortcuts, Ruby methods, problem solving approaches, and more subtly, ways of understaning concepts.</p>

			<p>Although I've felt positive about most of my pairing sessions, I've had trouble picking out specifically what I liked about my partner's contributions. I recently had the idea to think about this more during the session so that I could provide more specific feedback following our session. This has been a helpful strategy. Providing constructive critical feedback has been difficult for a different reason: I feel very uncomfortable with saying something that might hurt someone's feelings. I try to remind myself of what I know, logically - that what I have to say could help them iprove their skills. And then I do my best to present the feedback honestly and kindly.</p>

			<p>I found value in reading my received feedback, and this helped me better understand the value I could provide to others. Much of what I received was positive. The positive feedback helped me identify the techniques and practices I should continue to focus on. Meanwhile the constructive critical feedback helped me identify things I'd like to work on changing. My two most recent pieces pointed out that I am hesitant to speak up. And one partner identified me as a "quiet person." These things were very difficult for me to read, as these are qualities I have been trying to grow out of for my whole life. I have come so far in being articulate and assertive, but not as far as I would like. Still, I appreciate hearing this from others because it reminds me not only that I'm not where I want to be, but also that I can still work to improve in this area. Now, I am making an effort in my sessions to say what I think more confidently, while still respecting my partner's contributions.</p>

			<p>Teamwork is an important skill - one that can only be improved with practice and feedback. While the pairing done here at DBC is not always necessary to solve the problem at hand, my peers and I are practicing working productively with others so that we will be able to use these skills later toward larger, more complex goals.</p>
