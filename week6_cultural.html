			<p>Stereotype threat is a phenomenon in which a negatively stereotyped group's members' perfomance suffers due to the stereotype. For example, studies by Claude M. Steele show that black students' academic test scores were worse than similarly qualified white students' when the students were told that the test would measure intelligence. Meanwhile, the black and white students' performance was comparable when they were told that the test was not an indicator of intelligence. A similar study was done with women in mathematics, with their performance being compared to similarly qualified men's. In these scenarios, the claim that intelligence would be measured seems to have triggered a subconscious realization of the negative stereotypes to which these minority students have been exposed. </p>

			<p>Steele's results are not surprising to me.Early mammalian brains were designed to respond to potential threats with a stress response. This was a safety feature that increased a human's ability to escape from potential predators. Today, our brains still have this feature. However, in the US today, this stress response is more often set off by a standardized test than by a dangerous predator. Students who have been told that they are relatively less capable because of their race or gender will be disproportionately disadvantaged by this stress response.</p>

			<p>That being said, stereotype threat does not resonate with me, a woman, personally. Based on Steele's results, the phenomenon likely did affect my academic and work performance, as I have studied and worked in predominantly male fields. Of course I've had anxiety before academic tests and certain tasks at work. However, this was not consciously based on the fact that I feard confirming negaive female stereotypes. Sometimes, my gender was a source of anxiety when I felt it stood out. However, I don't differentiate this from anxiety I felt around my view of my personal shortcomings. In other words, fearing that I would fail because of who I am as an individual seems to have been just as detrimental to me as fearing that I would fail because I was a woman. I plan to combat either of these in the same way: By soliciting feedback from those around me, and expressing what I need in order to feel included and comfortable. Also, sometimes speaking my concerns about my performance aloud is helpful in and of itself.</p>

			<p>I feel that stereotype threat can be minimized as part of a braoder plan to welcome everyone in a particular setting. The key to this is communication. For any individual I work with, I believe they will perform best and be most comfortable if I make them feel welcome, respected, included, and heard. To engender these feelings, I will first ask about group members' preferences for working style and role. I will listen to members' ideas and respond respectfully. I'll provide positive feedback (only when I can do so honestly and sincerely). And last, I will have discussions with other students about our respective experiences. Sometimes, we can automatically assume that difficulties we experience are unique to us or our group. This feeling can be remedied by open discussion among people with all kinds of differences.</p>
