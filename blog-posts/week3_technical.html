			<h3></h3>
			<p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language that is popular in web development.JavaScript has always been implemented on the client-side, but is currently growing in popularity for use on the back end. JavaScript originated as part of the Netscape Navigator, which was once the dominant web browser. Moreover, it was the only language for dynamic front-end development. These attributes are a large part of why the language grew in popularity as much as it has. Another positive quality of JavaScript is that it is relatively easy to learn, as programming languages go. Furthermore, the more developers that adopted JavaScript, the more libraries developed. Today, there are quite a lot to choose from, improving the language's usability.</p>

			<h3>JavaScript on the Client Side</h3>
			<p>JavaScript has many capabilities that can be performed in other languages, either on the client or server side. Therefore, it is important to understand when javascript is and is not the optimal choice. As a general rule, client-side scripts should only be used when they serve a role that could not be performed as well on the backend. There are a few reasons for this. The first is site performance: A programmer cannot know how much memory or what type of browser will be used to view the site on the client side, and therefore cannot ensure good performance. The second is that a bug in a .js file can prevent the page from loading altogether. Another reason is security. When hackers have access to .js files on the front end, they can more easily hack a site. However, there are some tasks that benefit from being performed on the client side. One example is simple validation, for instance in a form. This may be performed more quickly on the client side than the back end. In this case, more complex validation will likely be needed in addition on the back end.</p>

			<h3>JavaScript on the Back End</h3>
			<p>Node.js is a JavaScript framework that has been increasing in popularity. This is in part because there are many developers already familiar with JavaScript. This means that they do not have to learn an entire new language in order to use node.js. Also, the introduction of node.js makes it possible to use a common language on the front end and backend. Although at the present, Node.js is not as robust as other commonly used backend web development framworks, it is expected to continue improving in this respect.</p>
