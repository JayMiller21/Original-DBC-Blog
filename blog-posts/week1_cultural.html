			<p><em>In this post, I'll be sharing my thoughts on <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat: Kitchen vs Table.</a></em></p>
			<h3>Kitchen vs Table Analogy</h3>
			<span>
				<p>Shereef uses an analogy to describe the mindset he hopes DBC students will enter with. He describes the western mentality of being a consumer of products and services, and having expectations in return for the money we spent. This is a common mentality when at table in a restaurant. He encourages students instead to think of ourselves in the kitchen, prepared and excited to make the experience amazing for ourselves, and for our cohort members and staff. I really appreciate the way he presented this idea. It's something I hadn't thought of explicitly, but I feel that the kitchen mentality will be essential to my success at DBC.</p>

			<h3>Imposter Syndrome</h3>
			<spam>
				<p>Shereef also addressed the fears that students will have walking into DBC. Among these was imposter syndrome. This is something that I have experienced for as long as I can remember. Everyone has strengths and everyone has weaknesses. I am intelligent, creative, and work well with others, but I am a slow learner. Disproportionate focus on this weakness can lead to the feeling that I shouldn't be regarded as well as I am. I am glad to know that I'm not the only one to experience this and I look forward to continuing to challenge this sentiment. Shereef offered comfort in the fact that regardless of difference in ability between students, in the big picture, we are all so early on our paths to becoming developers that the differences are negligible: We all have a lot to learn and offer.</p>

			<h3>Other Ideas</h3>
			<span>
				<p>Time Boxing: Shereef explained that time boxing will be an important aspect of our training at DBC. We will have goals to complete in a specified period of time, and must learn to prioritize completion. This is a skill I struggle with, and I look forward to improving it.</p>
				<p>Pairing: Shereef points out that human relationships are the biggest factor affecting companies' success or failure. I believe this is true, and I have been part of working environments that did not encourage vulnerability and human connection. Working in such environments has always felt lacking to me, and so I am excited that this is an emphasis at DBC.</p>
				<p>Preventing Burnout: A student spoke up with a concern that the program's work/life balance would be too far in favor of work. Shereef responds that this is a special 9 weeks - he wouldn't recommend that someone work this hard at a job over an extended period of time. He says, don't keep working past the point in the day that you stop learning. But do make the most of the experience.</p>
