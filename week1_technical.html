		<span class="center">
			<p><em>In this post, I'll be telling you about some of my favorite websites, and why their designs are great.</em></p>
		</span>
		<h3><a href="mail.google.com">Gmail</a></h3>
		<span class="maintext">
			<p>Google Mail, or Gmail, is a web app for receiving, sending, and viewing email. I would describe gmail's content as practical, enticing, addicting, productive, and social. While many of these adjectives highlight the pragmatic nature of this site, it is made quite enticing with its aesthetics.</p>
			<p>When I first open the app, my eyes are drawn to the main content area: my inbox. When I stand back, my eyes go to the surrounding areas: the header and left sidebar. Visually, I would describe the page as simple, intuitive, light, friendly, and welcoming.</p>
			<p>Beyond its ability to visually please, Gmail is easy to use. From the homepage, I can clearly see all of my options. In the left sidebar, I can see all folders of mail. In the top bar, I can access all of my settings with one button, search my mail, and access other google apps. When I go to a mail folder, a particular piece of mail, or the settings menu, the sidebar and top menu remain visible so that at any time, I can see all of my options.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, I feel very productive after spending time on this site. Other times, I'm aware that I feel compelled to keep spending time on there beyond the point that I am using my time well! Still, I wouldn't trade Gmail for just any mail app.</p>
		</span>
		<h3><a href="evernote.com">Evernote</a></h3>
		<span>
			<p>Like Gmail, Evernote makes a fun app with a practical purpose. I would describe Evernote's visual appearance as playful, simple, intuitive, organized, and direct. When I enter the site, my eyes are drawn to the panel with the notes. This is not ideal if I am not in the notebook I wish to be in at the moment, because I have to back track to see what notebook is open. If I step back my eyes go to the open note.</p>
			<p>Evernote is a web app for notetaking. I would describe its content as organized, varied, practical, project-oriented, and idea-oriented. Evernote is a versitle app that can be used to organize recipes, maintain a journal, clip internet articles, and more. </p>
			<p>Upon entering the site, I can see three panes from left to right: the first shows all of my notebooks, the second shows all of the notes inside the selected notebook, and the third displays the selected note to view and/or edit. In the header, there is a search bar, and access to my settings.</p>
			<p>This is a site that can really draw me in for longer than I intend. It makes me feel organized, and makes me want to continues organizing ideas and notes, and fleshing out outlines and journal entries.</p>
		</span>
		<h3><a href="nytimes.com">Nytimes.com</a></h3>
		<span>
			<p>Nytimes.com is the New York Times' online newspaper. I would describe its content as informative, political, worldly, journalistic, and cultural.</p>
			<p>The site does a good job of showing all it has to offer. Upon entering the site, my eyes are drwan to an image at the center of the page. Then they gently move to the article to the left, and over the remaining articles, which are layed out in a non-linear fashion in neighboring boxes nestled together inside the browser's view. Visually, I would describe the site as clean, cozy, fancy, formal, and neutral.</p>
			<p>The site naturally invites the viewer to click on one of the numerous headlines displayed on the front page. After doing so, a dropdown menu in the top left corner provides easy access to all of the paper's sections.</p>
			<p>After getting to the bottom of an article, the user is presented with links to related articles, as well as other popular articles. This feature is very good at drawing a reader in. When I reading a good article on nytimes.com, I feel excited about what I'm learning, and enticed to learn more - particularly when I get to those links at the bottom.</p>
