<!-- Remember your Gregorc Thinking Style from your pre-Phase 0 work? If you can't remember what you are, retake the personal thinking style quiz.

Research your thinking style and consider how you can use your understanding of your thinking style to your advantage at DBC to help you learn.

Consider your experience in Phase 0 to this point. What has been the biggest struggle for you? Is it related to the way you think and learn or is it related to something else? If it's related to your learning style, start thinking of strategies to help you. Put some plans of action in place.

Now, consider the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset. Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively. -->

			<p>Recently, I took a quiz to determine my personal thinking style. The quiz involved choosing adjectives and phrases that best described me: Words like "analytical," "independent," "experimenting." The quiz results suggested that I have a primarily "concrete random" thinking style, and secondarily "abstract random." The following are the points I tallied in each of the four thinking style categories presented:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Concrete Random: 10</li>
				<li>Abstract Random: 8</li>
				<li>Concrete Sequential: 6</li>
				<li>Abstract Sequential: 6</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I am logical. I succeed best when I can work through problems firsthand, using trial and error. Variety and mental stimulation are important for me to be engaged, and I have trouble performing tasks that are repetitive or not challenging, and attending to details. I am impulsive and have a lot of ideas and interests, and tend to start a lot of projects. However, I have trouble finishing what I start. I have trouble making decisions and committing to them. I am independent and have trouble following strict directions and adhering to time frames.
			<p>The DBC structure lends itself well to my thinking style in that I can work independently and flexibly to a large degree within each week. It also helps me that the material is a) almost all new to me, and b) has a wide scope. However it is hard for me to complete all of the requirements in order and on time. Time management has been by greatest difficulty so far. Indecision plays into this in the form of perfectionism: At times, I can't decide on the best approach to proceed with. I can end up paralyzed by indecision, or redoing a project aspect an unnecessary number of times.</p>
			<p>I am an advocate of self-knowledge, and pursuing work that aligns with one's strengths. However no job will be a perfect fit for a person. Ideally, the majority of the work will align will with her thinking style, but inevitably, some will not. This is the bad news. The good news is that thinking styles are not hardwired into our DNA. Just as health is based on both genetics and personal routines, so are mental fitness and aptitude. Therefore, I have the potential to improve in all skills and thinking styles. This understanding is the basis of a growth mindset.</p>
			<p>In this vein, I plan to embrace the working styles that come most naturally to me, and to continue working on those that do not as much. I have started by tracking the time it takes me to complete each task. When I feel I am taking too long, I try to figure out why. And I encourage myself to the bare minimum quality to complete an assignment before working on in-depth improvement of any aspect. It has been a struggle implementing these practices, but I have noticed that I am at least more aware of my use of time. I will continue to use these techniques, and adapt them as needed.</p>
